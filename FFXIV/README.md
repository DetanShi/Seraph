# About
FFXIV tools to be locally hosted. This is mainly for personal use and was not made with the intent to be widely utilized. As the FFXIV API changes and progress of closed source work continues I may not find time to update this repository.

# Current place in development 
Durring the pandemic I have had to halt work on the project for time being, and focus on my part time job and helping my family. I will merge code from the Discord bot Seraph to enable similar functionality for Character search and FC search. As for the Market Board feature it will be a link to https://universalis.app/ as their functionality is far beyond what I could develop in a multi-contect page.
